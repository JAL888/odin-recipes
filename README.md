This is my first attempt at creating a basic HTML website after going through TOP foundations course.

The focus for this project is to consolidate all I've learned through the HTML foundations such as:
- Creating an HTML file
- Writing HTML boilerplate
- Adding tex, images, links to the website
- Making Git commit(s)
